# Solana Test Validator (Forked v1.18.25)

This repository is a **forked version of Solana v1.18.25**, with a modification in the file `compute_budget_processor.rs` to increase the value of `MAX_COMPUTE_UNIT_LIMIT` to `u32::MAX` â€” the maximum possible compute units. This change is made to support the `bls12_381` operation, which requires more compute units than the original default limit.

## Setup and Running Solana Test Validator

Follow these steps to build and run the Solana test validator:

### 1. Move to the Solana Project

navigate to the Solana project folder using the following command:

```sh
cd solana_v1.18.25
```

### 2. Build the Project

First, you need to build the project. This can be done by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

This will build the Solana test validator in release mode.

### 3. Run the Solana Test Validator

Once the build is complete, run the Solana test validator using the following command:

```sh
./target/release/solana-test-validator
```

This will start the Solana test validator.

### 4. Restart the Solana Test Validator

If you need to restart the test validator for any reason, you can use the `-r` flag like this:

```sh
./target/release/solana-test-validator -r
```

This will restart the test validator, clearing the state and reinitializing the validator.

### 5. Test Ledger and Logs

The `test-ledger` folder, located under the `solana` directory, stores all the logs and data generated by the validator. Note that this folder can grow significantly and take up a lot of storage space. If you want to delete the data and free up storage, you can safely remove this folder:

```sh
rm -rf test-ledger
```

This will delete the stored data from the validator and reset it, but be cautious, as this will also remove any logs and ledger data.

## Key Changes in This Fork

- **Forked from Solana v1.18.25:** This repository is based on the v1.18.25 release of the Solana project.

- **Modification to** `compute_budget_processor.rs`**:** The `MAX_COMPUTE_UNIT_LIMIT` constant has been increased to `u32::MAX`, allowing the Solana test validator to support the `bls12_381` cryptographic operations, which require a higher compute unit limit.

## Notes:

- The `test-ledger` folder is critical for storing logs and validator data. It can become quite large and consume significant storage, especially when running the test validator over a long period.

- Be mindful of your disk space usage, and consider cleaning up the `test-ledger` folder if necessary.
